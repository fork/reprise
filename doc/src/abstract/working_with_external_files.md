# Working with external files in the Reprise Framework

## Overview

Working with external files in Reprise is a very straightforward task. For almost every filetype there is a dedicated class. External files in Reprise are loaded with *resources*. A resource is basically a command, which is tailored for the handling of external data. It has nifty features for reattempting the load procedure several times in the case of a failure, tricking the server to send uncached data by automatically appending timestamps and the like.
